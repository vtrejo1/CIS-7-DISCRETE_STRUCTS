Part 1: (5 points)

Let S = it is sunny, C = camping is fun, H = the homework is
done, and M = mathematics is easy.

    Translate into English: (M → H)∧(S →C)
    Translate into Propositional Logic: “Mathematics is easy or camping is fun, as long as it is sunny and the homework is done.”

    Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither: (¬B → ¬A) → ((¬B → A) → B)
    Use a truth table to determine whether this is a tautology, contradiction, or neither: ((A → B)∧(B → ¬A)) → A

Part 3: (5 points)

For each of the following pairs of propositions, show that the
two propositions are logically equivalent by finding a chain of equivalences from one
to the other. State which definition or law of logic justifies each equivalence in the
chain.

    (p ∧ q) → r , p → (q → r )
    (q ∨ r ) → p, (q → p)∧(r → p)

Part 4: (5 points)

Let Loves(x,y) mean “x loves y,” Traveler(x) mean “x is a traveler,”
City(x) mean “x is a city,” Lives(x,y) mean “x lives in y.”

    Translate into English: ∃x∀y∀z(City(x) ∧ Traveler (y)∧Li ves(z,x)) → (Loves(y,x)∧ ¬Loves(z,x))
    Translate into Predicate Logic: “No traveler loves the city they live in.”

Assuming: p → (q ∧ r ), s → r , r → p
Prove: s → q.

Assuming: ¬(r ∨ s), ¬p → s, p → q. 
Prove: q

Modus Ponen: If x -> q, and x, then q
Modus Tollens: If x -> q, and ~q, then ~x
