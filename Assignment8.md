  The video that was most helpful is the mathematical induction in the discreet math series. This video explains the process of induction and also provides a visual aid with the ladder analogy. Personally, I had trouble understanding the concept at first but visually seeing the proof from start to finish allowed me to process the logic better. At first I was just following steps but seeing the entire problem reminded me of a power series. What I understand is that the set of natural numbers will be equal and that the next iterations of natural number will also be equivalent.
