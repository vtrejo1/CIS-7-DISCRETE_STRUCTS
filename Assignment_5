Part 1: (10 points)

Proove each of the following. Indicate which proof method you are using and show your work.

    Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
    If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
    The sum of two odd integers is even. Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
    The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
    If n squared is odd, then n is odd

Part 2: (10 points)

    Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
    Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3
    Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3 Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
